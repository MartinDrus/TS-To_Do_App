# Task Manager

This is a simple task manager application built with JavaScript and TypeScript.

## Try It

You can try out the application by visiting [TS-To_Do_App](https://martindrus.github.io/TS-To_Do_App/).

## Usage

The application allows you to add new tasks by entering a task title and clicking the "Add Task" button. You can mark tasks as completed by checking the checkbox next to the task title. To delete a task, click the delete button (represented by a trash bin icon) next to the task title.

The tasks are saved using the browser's localStorage feature, allowing your tasks to persist even if you close or refresh the page.
